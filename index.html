            Researchers are solving one of the most puzzling questions in plate
            tectonics, by investigating how the Earth's surface has responded to
            the breakup of continental plates through time.

          <p class="research-card__description">
            Research by Southampton demographers has explored strategies to best
            address skills shortages caused by ageing and whether migration and
            the use of robotics can help alleviate some of the resulting
            pressures.
